## Setting up trained data language

The `mikado.traineddata` file is a file that has specifically trained on the Cookie Run: Kingdom font.

> To make it work, place this file in your `Tesseract-OCR/tessdata` location

- Note: if you would like to forgo this process, change `mikado` to `eng` for the `lang` parameter in `image_processing.py`
